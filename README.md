# Web Dev Starter Code

## Overview

This is a simple inventory web application that interacts with an AWS Lambda backend to manage inventory items.

The app allows users to:
- Load all items stored in the database
- Add new items using a form
- Delete existing items from the table

It demonstrates core web development concepts including DOM manipulation, AJAX requests, and serverless API integration. 

## How to Run

1. Clone the Git repository to your computer using VS Code or any code editor.

2. In VS Code, right-click on index.html and choose either: “Show Preview” or “Open in Browser”

3. The app will open in your browser, and you can use all inventory features immediately (load, add, and delete items)
